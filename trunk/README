XML and Java
============

Java is currently one of the most used server side programming languages, and 
casual java development usually involves lot's of XML processing. There are huge
APIs with solid implementations that have been there for decades, and yet, all 
these implementations are still causing problems. What is the API good for, if 
things that run on one implementation usually does not work with another? Why 
can a switch from Java 5 to Java 6 break XML parsers and processors? It should 
be different. 

============
Less is More
============
In many cases you will only need basic features for processing XML files, and in 
such cases there is no need to choke on huge APIs and implementations that 
support all the gore displayed above. By using bloatware you create new 
bloatware. Find the inspiration in minimalism, try XML Zen.
